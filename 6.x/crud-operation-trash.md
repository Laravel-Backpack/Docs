# Trash Operation <span class="badge badge-info">PRO</span>

--

<a name="about"></a>
## About

This CRUD operation allows your admins to soft delete, restore and permanently delete entries from the table. In other words, admins can send entries to the trash, recover them from trash or completely destroy them.

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

1. This is a <span class="badge badge-info">PRO</span> operation. It requires that you have [purchased access to `backpack/pro`](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro-for-unlimited-projects).

2. In addition, it needs that your Model uses Laravel's `SoftDeletes` trait. For that, you should:
- generate a migration to add the `deleted_at` column to your table, eg. `php artisan make:migration add_soft_deletes_to_products --table=products`;
- inside that file's `Schema::table()` closure, add `$table->softDeletes();`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- add `use SoftDeletes` on the corresponding model (and import that class namespace);

### How it Works
- **Trash**:
Using AJAX, a DELETE request is performed towards ```/entity-name/{id}/trash```, which points to the ```trash()``` method in your EntityCrudController.

- **Restore**:
Using AJAX, a PUT request is performed towards ```/entity-name/{id}/restore```, which points to the ```restore()``` method in your EntityCrudController.

- **Destroy**:
Using AJAX, a DELETE request is performed towards ```/entity-name/{id}/destroy```, which points to the ```destroy()``` method in your EntityCrudController.

<a name="enabling"></a>
### How to Use

**Step 1.** If your EntityCrudController uses the `DeleteOperation`, remove it. `TrashOperation` is a complete alternative to `DeleteOperation`.

**Step 2.** You need to ```use \Backpack\Pro\Http\Controllers\Operations\TrashOperation;``` inside your EntityCrudController. Ideally the TrashOperation should be the last one that gets used. For example:

```php
class ProductCrudController extends CrudController
{
    // ... other operations
    use \Backpack\Pro\Http\Controllers\Operations\TrashOperation;
}
```
This will make a Trash button and Trashed filter show up in the list view, and will enable the routes and functionality needed for the operation. If you're getting a "Trait not found" exception, make sure in the namespace you have typed `Backpack\Pro`, not `Backpack\PRO`.


<a name="how-to-configure"></a>
### How to configure

You can easily disable the default trash filter:
```php
public function setupTrashOperation()
{
    CRUD::setOperationSetting('withTrashFilter', false);
}
```

Disabling the filter also will make the trashed items show in your List view.  Note that, by default, the `Destroy` button is only shown in _trashed items_. If you want to allow your admins to _permanently delete_ without sending first to trash... you can achieve that by defining in your operation setup:

```php
// in the setupTrashOperation method
CRUD::setOperationSetting('canDestroyNonTrashedItems', true);
```

<a name="how-to-control-access-to-operation-actions"></a>
### How to control access to operation actions

When used, `TrashOperation` each action inside this operation (`trash`, `restore` and `destroy`) checks for access, before being performed.  Likewise, `BulkTrashOperation` checks for access to `bulkTrash`, `bulkRestore` and `bulkDestroy`.

That means you can revoke access to some operations, depending on user roles or anything else you want:
```php
// if user is not superadmin, don't allow permanently delete items
public function setupTrashOperation()
{
    if(! backpack_user()->hasRole('superadmin')) {
         CRUD::denyAccess('destroy');
    }
}
```

<a name="how-to-override"></a>
### How to Override

In case you need to change how this operation works, just create ```trash()```, ```restore()```,```destroy()``` methods in your EntityCrudController, and they will be used instead of the default ones. For example for `trash()`:

```php
use \Backpack\Pro\Http\Controllers\Operations\TrashOperation { trash as traitTrash; }

public function trash($id)
{
    CRUD::hasAccessOrFail('trash');

    // your custom code here
}
```

You can also override the buttons by creating a file with the same name inside your ```resources/views/vendor/backpack/crud/buttons/```. You can easily publish the buttons there to make changes using:

```zsh
php artisan backpack:button --from=trash

php artisan backpack:button --from=restore

php artisan backpack:button --from=destroy
```

<a name="trash-multiple-items-bulk-trash"></a>
## BulkTrash (Trash Multiple Items) <span class="badge badge-info">PRO</span>

In addition to the button for each entry, <span class="badge badge-info">PRO</span> developers can show checkboxes next to each element, to allow their admin to trash, restore & delete multiple entries at once.


<a name="how-it-works"></a>
### How it Works

- **BulkTrash**:
Using AJAX, a DELETE request is performed towards ```/entity-name/{id}/bulk-trash```, which points to the ```bulkTrash()``` method in your EntityCrudController.

- **BulkRestore**:
Using AJAX, a PUT request is performed towards ```/entity-name/{id}/bulk-restore```, which points to the ```bulkRestore()``` method in your EntityCrudController.

- **BulkDestroy**:
Using AJAX, a DELETE request is performed towards ```/entity-name/{id}/bulk-destroy```, which points to the ```bulkDestroy()``` method in your EntityCrudController.

### How to Use

Assuming your Model already uses Larave's `SoftDeletes`, you just need to ```use \Backpack\Pro\Http\Controllers\Operations\BulkTrashOperation;``` on your EntityCrudController.

<a name="how-to-override"></a>
### How to Override

In case you need to change how this operation works, just create a ```bulkTrash()```, `bulkRestore()` or `bulkDestroy()`  methods in your EntityCrudController:

```php
use \Backpack\Pro\Http\Controllers\Operations\BulkTrashOperation { bulkTrash as traitBulkTrash; }

public function bulkTrash($id)
{
    CRUD::hasAccessOrFail('bulkTrash');

    // your custom code here
}
```

You can also override the buttons by creating a file with the same name inside your ```resources/views/vendor/backpack/crud/buttons/```. You can easily publish the buttons there to make changes using:

```zsh
php artisan backpack:button --from=bulk_trash

php artisan backpack:button --from=bulk_restore

php artisan backpack:button --from=bulk_destroy
```

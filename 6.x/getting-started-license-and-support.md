## Add-ons

In addition to our core package (CRUD), we have quite a few packages you can install or download, that treat common use cases. Some have been developed by our core team, some by our wonderful community. For example, we have plug&play interfaces to manage [site-wide settings](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/Settings), [the default Laravel users table](https://github.com/eduardoarandah/UserManager), [users, groups & permissions](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/PermissionManager), [content for custom pages, using page templates](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/PageManager), [news articles, categories and tags](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/NewsCRUD), etc.

## License


Backpack is open-core. The features you'll find in our docs are split into two packages:

- [Backpack\CRUD](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/crud) is the core, released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/blob/master/LICENSE.md) (free, open-source); <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">FREE</span>
- [Backpack\PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro-for-unlimited-projects) is a Backpack add-on, released under our [EULA](https://backpackforlaravel.com/eula) (paid, closed-source); <span class="badge badge-pill badge-info">PRO</span>

Backpack\CRUD is perfect if you're building a simple admin panel - it's packed with features! It's also perfect if you're building an open-source project, the permissive license allows you to do whatever you want.

When your admin panel grows and your needs become more complex, you can purchase our [Backpack\PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro-for-unlimited-projects) add-on, which adds A LOT of features for complex use-cases (see [list here]([Backpack\Pro](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro-for-unlimited-projects))). Our documentation includes instructions on how to use both Backpack\CRUD and Backpack\PRO, with all the PRO features clearly labeled <span class="badge badge-pill badge-info">PRO</span>

## Support

We offer free support for all our packages. If you report a bug, we will do our best to fix it in a timely manner. We publish a new patch version weekly, launch new features every month and major versions yearly. But please note that support does _not_ mean we can help with debugging, implementation issues specific to your project, brainstorming on solutions for your project, jumping on Zoom/Meet calls etc. We'd love to, but we just cannot do that, with thousands of developers using Backpack and such a small price. But. We do have good documentation and have been blessed with a **great community**, where people help each other out. If Backpack becomes your tool of choice, I highly recommend you join our gang. Help others with your experience, report bugs, create cool stuff and even influence the direction of Backpack. Use:

- **[StackOverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel) for help requests**. If you need help creating something using Backpack, post your question on StackOverflow using the ```backpack-for-laravel``` tag. We've been blessed with a great community that is happy to help. Who doesn't like getting StackOverflow points?
- **[Community Forum Issues](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/community-forum) for bugs**. Found a bug? Great! Please search for it on GitHub first - someone might have already found it. If not, open an issue, we're happy to make Backpack better.
- **[Community Forum Discussions](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/community-forum/discussions) for showing off your work, asking for opinions on implementation, sharing tips, packages, etc.**

Thank you for sticking up with us for so long. This is the last Backpack lesson we can give you. **Now you have absolutely no excuse - time to start your first Backpack project :-)** But here are a few more links, if you still don't think you're ready:

- [Go through the demo](/docs/{{version}}/demo) and play around
- Read this [CRUD Crash Course](/docs/{{version}}/crud-tutorial) and do the steps yourself
- Take a look at the [CrudController API Cheat Sheet](/docs/{{version}}/crud-cheat-sheet)

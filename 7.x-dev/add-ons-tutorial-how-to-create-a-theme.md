# Create a new Backpack Theme

-----

This tutorial will create and package a Backpack theme, so that you can use it in multiple Laravel projects. And if you open-source it, others can do the same.


<a name="create-working-code"></a>
## Part A. Build the Theme in Your Project

Here are the steps to easily build a **Backpack** theme using a template you got from **GetBootstrap**, **WrapBootstrap** or **ThemeForest**.

### Step 1. Create theme directory

Create a view folder anywhere in your `resources/views`. This is the directory where you will place all the files for your theme.

```bash
mkdir resources/views/my-cool-theme
```

### Step 2. Use that directory as your view namespace

In your `config/backpack/ui.php`, add that as the primary view namespace:

```php
    'view_namespace' => 'my-cool-theme.',
```

> **Notes:**
> - Notice the `.` at the end of the namespace, that's important.
> - The namespace must match the name of the folder created from the previous step.

### Step 3. Choose and use a fallback theme

A fallback theme is needed in cases when Backpack attempts to load a view that doesn't exist in your theme. It means you don't need to create all the views in order to create a theme... Phew! You can easily rely on your fallback theme and only create the views you need to customize. In order to do so, edit your config file `config/backpack/ui.php` as it follows:

```php
    'view_namespace' => 'my-cool-theme.',
    'view_namespace_fallback' => 'backpack.theme-coreuiv4::', // <--- this line
```

If it's your first time creating a Backpack theme, we recommend you start from our CoreUIv4 theme, and use that as your fallback. It's the simplest modern theme we have. It uses Bootstrap v5, but doesn't have any extra features you'd need to also support (like Tabler does). If you don't already have it installed, you will need to do `composer require backpack/theme-coreuiv4`

### Step 4. Create the main blade files

If you refresh the page right now, it will show up IDENTICAL to CoreUIv4. Why? Because you're using all the blade files from that theme (through the fallback system). How can you make _your theme_ look like _your theme_? By overriding some of blade files the fallback theme provides. Similar to how child themes work in Wordpress.

Feel free to look at your fallback theme's views (eg. `vendor/backpack/theme-coreuiv4/resources/views`). If you create a file with the same file in your theme directory (eg. `resources/views/my-cool-theme`), your view will be picked up.

So let's do that. Let's create _most_ of the files you'll need to customize, to provide _your theme_ with _your style_:
```
- my-cool-theme/
  - assets/
      - css/
         ...here you can place all css files provided by your theme
      - js/
         ...here you can place all js files provided by your theme
  - inc/
      theme_styles.blade.php
      theme_scripts.blade.php
      ...
  - components/
      ...here you can override widgets with your own
  - layouts/
      app.blade.php
  - widgets/
      ...here you can override widgets with your own
```

Now let's build those files... Let's start with what makes a theme different.

#### Theme styles

The `my-cool-theme/inc/theme_styles.blade.php` file should hold all custom CSS that your theme needs. For example:

```php
{{-- You can load files directly from CDNs, they will get cached and loaded from local --}}
@basset('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css')

{{-- You can also load files from any place in your application directories --}}
@basset(views_path('my-cool-theme/assets/css/extra.css'))

{{-- You can also write inline CSS blocks --}}
@bassetBlock('my-cool-theme/custom-styling')
<style>
.something {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
</style>
@endBassetBlock
```

Note: Don't forget to load the Bootstrap CSS. Backpack does NOT load it by default.

#### Theme scripts

The `my-cool-theme/inc/theme_scripts.blade.php` file should hold all custom JS that your theme needs:

```php
{{-- You can load files directly from CDNs, they will get cached and loaded from local --}}
@basset('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js')

{{-- You can also load files from any place in your application directories --}}
@basset(views_path('my-cool-theme/assets/css/extra.js'))

{{-- You can also write inline JS blocks --}}
@bassetBlock('my-cool-theme/custom-scripting')
<script>
 alert('got here');
</script>
@endBassetBlock
```

Note: Don't forget to load the Bootstrap JS. Backpack does NOT load it by default.

#### Default layout

`my-cool-theme/layouts/default.blade.php` will be the primary layout for your theme. So it has to contain a full HTML page: the HTML doctype declaration, head, body components, everything. The following example will help you get started.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ app()->getLocale() }}" dir="{{ backpack_theme_config('html_direction') }}">
<head>
    @include(backpack_view('inc.head'))
</head>
<body class="{{ backpack_theme_config('classes.body') }}">

    @include(backpack_view('inc.sidebar'))

    <div class="wrapper d-flex flex-column min-vh-100 bg-light">

        @include(backpack_view('inc.main_header'))

        <div class="app-body flex-grow-1 px-2">

            <main class="main">

                @yield('before_breadcrumbs_widgets')
                @includeWhen(isset($breadcrumbs), backpack_view('inc.breadcrumbs'))
                @yield('after_breadcrumbs_widgets')

                @yield('header')

                <div class="container-fluid animated fadeIn">

                    @yield('before_content_widgets')
                    @yield('content')
                    @yield('after_content_widgets')

                </div>

            </main>

        </div>{{-- ./app-body --}}

        <footer class="{{ backpack_theme_config('classes.footer') }}">
            @include(backpack_view('inc.footer'))
        </footer>
    </div>

    @include(backpack_view('inc.bottom'))
</body>
</html>
```

We recommend you copy-paste your own HTML above it, then include the `@directives` where they make sense in your layout. Their names should explain pretty well what they do.

Next up, we'll have to drill down. And move any custom content that's needed for the layout... for example for the sidebar, the header, the topbar... into their own respective views.


#### Head

There should be no reason for you to create and customize a `my-cool-theme/inc/head.blade.php` file.

#### Sidebar

Regarding `my-cool-theme/inc/sidebar.blade.php` we recommend you:
- create the file;
- paste the `main_header.blade.php` from your fallback theme;
- paste the HTML content you want;
- copy the useful things from the fallback theme to your own HTML, then delete whatever you don't want;

Do not drill down to customize `sidebar_content.blade.php` too. Menu items work a little different than other views - they are _view components_. So instead of customizing `sidebar_content.blade.php` take a few minutes and customize the menu items HTML, by copy-pasting the `components` directory from your fallback theme, then customizing the files inside it (`menu-item`, `menu-dropdown`, `menu-dropdown-item`, `menu-separator` etc).

#### Main header

Regarding `my-cool-theme/inc/main_header.blade.php` we recommend you:
- create the file;
- paste the `main_header.blade.php` from your fallback theme;
- paste the HTML content you want;
- copy the useful things from the fallback theme to your own HTML, then delete whatever you don't want;

#### Breadcrumbs

Most often `my-cool-theme/inc/breadcrumbs.blade.php` is not needed - breadrcumbs will look ok out-of-box, because they use regular Bootstrap structure and style. But if you do need to customize the breadcrumbs, follow the same process above to re-use everything you need from the fallback theme file.

#### Footer

Most often `my-cool-theme/inc/footer.blade.php` is not needed, the footer will look ok out-of-box. But if you do need to customize the breadcrumbs, follow the same process above to re-use everything you need from the fallback theme file.

#### Bottom

There should be no reason for you to create and customize a `my-cool-theme/inc/bottom.blade.php` file.

#### Other blade files

Feel free to duplicate any blade files from your fallback theme into your own theme, to customize them. But do this with moderation - if you're only changing style (not HTML structure), it's much better to make those changes using CSS.

### Step 5. Add CSS to make it pretty

For any Backpack pages or components that don't look pretty in your theme, feel free to customize them using CSS. In step 4 in `theme_styles.blade.php` we have already shown you how to include a custom CSS file, to hold all your custom styles.

### Step 6. Make it public

If you're proud of how your theme looks and want to share it with others in the Backpack community:
- make sure you have the rights to make the code public; if you've purchased an HTML template, you most likely _do not_ have the right to make their HTML & CSS public;
- consider adding the rest of the views from your fallback theme to yours; there's a choice here - either you make your package depend on your fallback theme (add it to `composer.json`)... or you copy-paste their files in yours, so that your theme be independent;
- follow the steps below to create a Backpack add-on using your theme;

<a name="create-the-package"></a>
## Part B. Create The Package


<a name="generate-package-folder"></a>
### Step 1. Generate the package folder

Let's install this excellent package that will make everything a lot faster:
```sh
composer require jeroen-g/laravel-packager --dev
```

Let's create our package. Instead of using their skeleton, we're going to use the Backpack [addon-skeleton](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/theme-skeleton):

```sh
php artisan packager:new --i --skeleton="https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/theme-skeleton/archive/master.zip"
```

It will then ask you some basic information about the package. Keep in mind:
- the ```vendor-name``` should probably be your GitHub handle (or organisation), in kebab-case (ex: `company-name`); it will be used for folder names, but also for GitHub and Packagist links;
- the ```package-name``` should be in `kebab-case` too (ex: ```moderate-operation```);
- the `skeleton`, if you haven't copied the entire command above, should probably be the one we provide: `https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/addon-skeleton/archive/master.zip`, which has everything you need to quickly create a Backpack add-on, including an innovative `AddonServiceProvider` that "_just works_";
- the ```website``` should be a valid URL, so include the protocol too: ```http://example.com```;
- the ```description``` should be pretty short; you can change it later in `composer.json`;
- the ```license``` is just the license name, if it's a common one (ex: ```MIT```, ```GPLv2```); our skeleton assumes you want `MIT` but you can easily change it;

OK great. The command has:
- created a ```/packages/vendor-name/package-name``` folder in your root directory;
- modified your project's ```composer.json``` file to load the files in this new folder;

This new folder should hold all your package files. You're off to a great start, because you're using our package skeleton (aka template), so it's already a _working package_. And it's already got a good file structure. Excited by how easy it'll be to make it work? Excellent, let's do it.

> If you want to test that your package is being loaded, you can do a ```dd('got here')``` inside your package's ```AddonServiceProvider::boot``` method. If you refresh the page, you should see that ```dd()``` statement executed.

<a name="initialize-git-repo-and-make-first-commit"></a>
### Step 1. Initialize a git repo and make your first package commit

Let's save what we have so far - the generated files:
```bash
# go to the package folder (of course - use your names here)
cd packages/vendor-name/package-name

# create a new git repo
git init

# (optional, but recommended)
# by default the skeleton includes folders for most of the stuff you need
# so that it's easier to just drag&drop files there; but you really
# shouldn't have folders that you don't use in your package;
# so an optional but recommended step here would be to
# delete all .gitkeep files, so that you leave the
# empty folders empty; that way, you can still
# drag&drop stuff into them, but Git will
# ignore the empty folders
find . -name ".gitkeep" -print # shows all .gitkeep files, to double-check
find . -name ".gitkeep" -exec rm -rf {} \; # deletes all .gitkeep files

# commit the initially generated files
git add .
git commit -am "generated package code using laravel-packager and the backpack theme-skeleton"
```

Excellent. Now we have _two_ git repos, that we can use as a progress indicator:
- the _project_ repo, where the files are uncommitted;
- the _package_ repo, where we'll be moving the functionality;

If you've used a git client you can even place them side-by-side, and see the progress as you move files from the project (left) to the package (right). But you don't _have to_ do that, it's just a nice visual indicator if it's your first package:

![Two git repos - the project and the new package](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1032474/101024271-85af3100-357c-11eb-9a51-605b003a0a53.png)

<a name="define-dependencies"></a>
### Step 2. Define any extra dependencies

Your ```/packages/vendor-name/package-name/composer.json``` file already requires the latest version of Backpack (thanks to the addon skeleton). If your package needs any third-party packages apart from Backpack and Laravel, make sure to add them to the `require` section. If you theme does NOT provide all needed files, and still sues something from a fallback theme, you MUST require that theme in your package's `composer.json` and instruct people to use it as the fallback.

<a name="move-the-files-needed-for-the-theme"></a>
### Step 3. Move the blade files from your project to your package

Time to move files from your _project_ to your _package_. You can use whatever you want for that - drag&drop, the command line, your IDE or editor, whatever you want.

![Moving files from your project to your package](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1032474/101025619-821ca980-357e-11eb-82fb-0d0e57ad6e3f.gif)


As you do that, your `git status` or git client should show fewer and fewer files in your _project_, and more and more files in your _package_.

<a name="test-that-it-works"></a>
### Step 4. Test that the package works

To use the blade files from your _package_ instead of your _project_, change the view namespace in `config/backpack/ui.php` to point to this new package you created:

```php
    'view_namespace' => 'vendor-name.package-name::',
    'view_namespace_fallback' => 'backpack.theme-coreuiv4::',
```

That's pretty much it. You've created your package! 🥳 All the files your package need are inside your package, and the only remaining changes in your project (as reflected by `git status`) should be the minimal changes that users need to do to install your package.

Go ahead and test it in the browser. Make sure the functionality that was working inside your _project_ is still working now that it's inside a _package_. You might have forgotten something - we all do sometimes.

<a name="delete-files-you-dont-need"></a>
### Step 5. Delete the package files you don't need

Now that you know your package is working, go through the package folder and delete whatever your package isn't actually using: empty directories, empty files, placeholder files. Clean it up a little bit.


<a name="customize-markdown-files"></a>
### Step 6. Customize Markdown Files

Inside your package folder, go through all markdown files and make them your own. At the very least, open the `README.md` file and spend a little time on it, give it some love:
- write a clear description;
- add a screenshot if appropriate;
- write clear installation instructions (step-by-step) for how to use your package;
- answer any questions users might have about what the package does;
- link to whatever dependencies or resources your add-on uses, so that they check out their docs instead of bugging you about it;

If you plan to make this package public, take the `README.md` seriously, because it's a HUGE factor in how popular your package can become. If you include clear documentation and screenshots, more people will use your package - guaranteed.


<a name="put-the-package-online"></a>
## Part C. Put The Package Online


First, [create a new GitHub Repository](https://github.com/new) for it. Remember to use the same name you defined in your package's ```composer.json```. If in doubt, double-check.

Second, add that new GitHub Repo as a remote, and push your code to your new GitHub repo.

```bash
# save your working files to Git
git add .
git commit -am "working code for v1.0.0"

# add the remote to Github
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepository.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m 'First version'
git push --tags
```

The tags are the way you will version your package, so it's important you do it.


<a name="make-the-package-public"></a>
## Part D. Make the package public (on Packagist)

In order for people to be able to install your package using Composer, your package needs to be registered with [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/), Composer's free package registry.

On [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/), submit a new package. Enter your package's GitHub URL and click Check. If any errors occur, follow the onscreen instructions. When you're done, you're taken to your package's Packagist page.

**Congrats, you have a working package online**, you can now install it using Composer.

Note: On the package page, you might get a notice like this: _This package is not auto-updated. Please set up the [GitHub Service Hook](https://packagist.org/profile/) for Packagist so that it gets updated whenever you push!_ Let's take care of that. Click that link, get your API token and go to your package's GitHub page, in Settings / Webhooks & Services / Add a new service. Search for Packagist. Enter your username and the token and hit Submit. Your error in Packagist should disappear in 5–10 minutes.


<a name="install-the-repo-from-github"></a>
## Part E. Install the repo from GitHub

If you look close to your project's `composer.json` file, you'll notice your project is loading the package from `packages/vendor-name/package-name`. Which is fine, it's worked fine until now. But it's now time to install the package like your users will, and have it in `vendor/vendor-name/package-name`. That way:
- you test that your users are able to install the package;
- you don't commit anything extra inside your project;
- you can _easily_ make changes to your package, from whatever project you're using it in;

To do that, go ahead and do this to uninstall your package from your project:
```bash
cd ../../.. # so that you're inside your project, not package

# discard the changes in your composer files
# and delete the files from packages/vendor-name/package-name
php artisan packager:remove vendor-name package-name
```

And now install it exactly the same as your users will:
- if it's closed-source, add the GitHub repo to your `composer.json` then move on to the next step; do NOT do this if your package is open-source:

```json
    "repositories": {
        "vendor-name/package-name": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/vendor-name/package-name"
        }
    }
```

- both for closed-source and open-source (on Packagist), install it using Composer's `--prefer-source` flag, so that it pulls the actual GitHub repo:

```bash
composer require vendor-name/package-name --prefer-source
```

That's it. It should be working fine now, but from the `vendor/vendor-name/package-name` directory. You can `cd vendor/vendor-name/package-name` and you'll see that you can `git checkout master`, make changes, tag releases, push to GitHub, everything.


<a name="feedback-and-promotion"></a>
### Feedback and Promotion

Congratulations on your new Backpack theme! To get feedback, ask people to try it by opening a Discussion in the [Backpack Community Forum](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/community-forum/discussions). After you've gotten some feedback, and a few users have installed your package and everything seems fine, time to promote it big time:
- post it to [laravel-news.com/links](https://laravel-news.com/links)
- show it off in the [Laracasts forum](https://laracasts.com/discuss)
- ask people to try it in [laravel.io](https://laravel.io/forum)

Have patience. It takes time to build up a user base, especially if it's your first open-source package. But treat every user as a friend, and you'll soon get there!
